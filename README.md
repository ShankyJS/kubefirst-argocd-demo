## What is K3d?

k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Lab's minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker. k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes

## Creating our K3d environment

In order to create our K3d environment there are some prerequisites

1. Docker should be installed and up and running.
2. A Github account with a GITHUB_TOKEN exposed as an env var in our shell.

Then we can run the following

```bash
kubefirst k3d create
```

## Login credentials

If you need the credentials to log in to any of the internal systems run the following command:

```bash
kubefirst k3d root-credentials
